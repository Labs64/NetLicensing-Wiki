<span id="title-text"> NetLicensing Wiki : Transferring licenses between licensees </span>
==========================================================================================

Created by <span class="author"> Konstantin Korotkov</span>, last

Motivation
==========

In NetLicensing, [licenses](NetLicensing-Object-Model_11010225.html) are
bound to the [licensee](NetLicensing-Object-Model_11010225.html) via
*licensee number* - unique identifier for the licensee. When
NetLicensing used with external eCommerce system, it is often not
possible to pass existing *licensee number* to a shopping session, so
that newly purchased licenses are bound to already existing licensee.
This makes it difficult to use external eCommerce together with
[licensing models](Licensing-Models_11010230.html) requiring licenses
renewal or extension, such as [Subscription](11010234.html) or
[Pay-per-Use](Pay-per-Use_11010233.html). To overcome this problem,
NetLicensing allows to bind renewal / extension licenses to a temporary
licensee, and transfer these licenses to the target licensee later on.

Workflow
========

In the following workflow we will use the term *licensee number* when
referring to NetLicensing and *license key* when referring to an
external eCommerce system. When using NetLicensing with external
eCommerce, *licensee number* is mapped to eCommerce's *license key*.

Typical flow for eCommerce shopping session:

1.  Customer enters online shop via link provided by vendor / software
2.  Customer adds products (licenses) to the shopping cart
3.  Customer goes through payment process
4.  eCommerce system executes custom fulfillment script configured by
    vendor, that returns *license key* -\> connection to NetLicensing
5.  eCommerce delivers *license key* to the customer

Fulfillment script for NetLicensing will typically do the following:

1.  Create new licensee and receive its *licensee number*
2.  Add licenses according to the shopping cart content
3.  Mark licensee for transfer
4.  Return the new *licensee number* as *license key*

And here's how the software will use the *license key* that customer
received from eCommerce:

1.  Obtain the *license key* from the user
2.  Call [transfer](Licensee-Services_11010217.html) method for own
    *licensee number*, passing the received *license key* as source
    *licensee number*
3.  [Validate](Licensee-Services_11010217.html) as usual for own
    *licensee number*

Above workflow assumes that own *licensee number* already exists,
naturally, *license key* received from eCommerce for the first time can
as well be assigned as own *licensee number*.
