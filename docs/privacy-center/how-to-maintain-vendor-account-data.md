How to maintain vendor account data
===================================

You must inform your customers about the terms and privacy policy
applicable to your products and services before they proceed with the
final step in the checkout process.

To make this information easily accessible to your customers we
encourage you to maintain your
<a href="https://ui.netlicensing.io/#/profile" class="external-link">vendor data</a> by providing up-to-date and correct *Legal Information*, *Address* and *Contact Cnformation*.

<a href="https://ui.netlicensing.io/#/profile" class="external-link"><img src="assets/images/vendor-profile.png" title="Vendor Profile" alt="Vendor Profile" width="600" /></a>

This information will be used in the [NetLicensing Shop](netlicensing-shop) checkout and order confirmation/invoice.
