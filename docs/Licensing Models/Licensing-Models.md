<span id="title-text"> Licensing Models </span>

Labs64 NetLicensing is sophisticated enough to cover even the most
outlandish licensing models: from single-user to network overflow
licenses. Labs64 NetLicensing provides the software vendor with the
ability to map/combine numerous licensing models.

Licensing models combine different parameters that define how a product
can be used by the end user. NetLicensing offers you the flexibility to
assign multiple licensing models to your product, so you can create a
composite licensing model that is specific to your needs. With
NetLicensing you can define licensing models for specific customers,
geographies, business models, or any other criteria.

This table provides a description and configuration specifics for
licensing models supported by NetLicensing as well as some of the
possible licensing models and combinations that can be adopted by
NetLicensing.

The business value is likely to be not at all related to CPU cycles or processes invoked.</td>
