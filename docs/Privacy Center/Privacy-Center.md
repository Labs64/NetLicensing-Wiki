The GDPR is effective on May 25, 2018, and setting a high bar for global
privacy rights and compliance. We prepared our business and compliance
processes for the GDPR to take effect, and this guide is intended to
help our customers/vendors do the same.

<span class="aui-icon icon-problem">Icon</span>

Please note that this guide is for informational purposes only, and
should not be relied upon as legal advice. We encourage you to work with
legal and other professional counsel to determine precisely how the GDPR
might apply to your organization.

What is the GDPR?
=================

The General Data Protection Regulation, a European privacy law approved
by the European Commission in 2016. The GDPR replaced a prior European
Union privacy directive known as Directive 95/46/EC, which has been the
basis of European data protection law since 1995.

A regulation such as the GDPR is a binding act, which must be followed
in its entirety throughout the EU. The GDPR is an attempt to strengthen,
harmonize, and modernize EU data protection law and enhance individual
rights and freedoms, consistent with the European understanding of
privacy as a fundamental human right. The GDPR regulates, among other
things, how individuals and organizations may obtain, use, store, and
eliminate personal data.

The GDPR was adopted in April 2016 and is effective on <span
class="underline">May 25, 2018</span>.

Who does it affect?
-------------------

The scope of the GDPR is very broad. The GDPR affects all organizations
established in the EU, and all organizations involved in processing
personal data of EU citizens. The latter is the GDPR’s introduction of
the principle of “extraterritoriality”; meaning, the GDPR applies to any
organization processing personal data of EU citizens - regardless of
where it is established, and regardless of where its processing
activities take place. This means the GDPR could apply to any
organization anywhere in the world, and all organizations should perform
an analysis to determine whether or not they are processing the personal
data of EU citizens. The GDPR also applies across all industries and
sectors.

What is considered “personal data”?
-----------------------------------

Per the GDPR, personal data is any information relating to an identified
or identifiable individual; meaning, *information that could be used, on
its own or in conjunction with other data, to identify an individual*.
Consider the extremely broad reach of that definition. Personal data now
includes not only data that is commonly considered to be personal in
nature (e.g. social security numbers, names, physical addresses, email
addresses), but also data such as IP addresses, behavioural data,
location data, biometric data, financial information, and much more.
This means that, for NetLicensing vendors, at least a majority of the
information that you collect about your end-customers can be considered
personal data under the GDPR. It’s also important to note that even
personal data that has been “pseudonymized” can be considered personal
data if the pseudonym can be linked to any particular individual.

<span class="aui-icon icon-warning">Icon</span>

Sensitive personal data, such as health information or information that
reveals a person’s racial or ethnic origin, will require even greater
protection. You should not store data of this nature within your
NetLicensing vendor account.

What does it mean to “process” data?
------------------------------------

Per the GDPR, processing is *“any operation or set of operations which
is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or
not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization,
structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation,
use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making
available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or
destruction”*. Basically, if you are collecting, managing, using or
storing any personal data of EU citizens, you are processing EU personal
data within the meaning prescribed by the GDPR. This means, for example,
that if any of your NetLicensing data entities (e.g. *Licensee*,
*License, Transaction*) contains the email address, name, or other
personal data of any EU citizen, then you are processing EU personal
data under the GDPR.

Keep in mind that even if you do not believe your business is affected
by the GDPR, the GDPR and its underlying principles may still be
important to you. European law tends to set the trend for international
privacy regulation, and increased privacy awareness now may give you a
competitive advantage later.

Do you need to comply with the GDPR?
====================================

You should consult with legal and other professional counsel regarding
the full scope of your compliance obligations. Generally speaking,
however, if you are an organization that is organized in the EU or one
that is processing the personal data of EU citizens, the <span
class="underline">GDPR will apply to you</span>.

Does it matter whether you are a controller or a processor?
===========================================================

If you access personal data, you do so as either a *controller* or a
*processor*, and there are different requirements and obligations
depending on which category you are in.

A **controller** is an organization that determines the purposes and
means of processing personal data. A controller also determines the
specific personal data that is collected from a data subject for
processing.

A **processor** is an organization that processes the data on behalf of
the controller.

The GDPR has not changed the fundamental definitions of controller and
processor, but it has expanded the responsibilities of each party.

Controllers will retain primary responsibility for data protection
(including, for example, the obligation to report data breaches to data
protection authorities); however, the GDPR does place some direct
responsibilities on the processor, as well. Accordingly, it is important
to understand whether you are acting as a controller or a processor and
to familiarize yourself with your responsibilities accordingly.

<span class="aui-icon icon-hint">Icon</span>

In the context of the NetLicensing application and our related services,
in the majority of circumstances, our <span
class="underline">**customers/vendors**</span> are acting as the <span
class="underline">**controller**</span>. Vendors, for example, decide
what information from their end-customers is uploaded or transferred
into their NetLicensing account. <span
class="underline">**NetLicensing**</span> is acting as a <span
class="underline">**processor**</span> by performing these and other
services for our customers/vendors.

How NetLicensing comply with the GDPR?
======================================

NetLicensing is excited about the GDPR and the strong data privacy and
security principles that it emphasizes, many of which NetLicensing
instituted long before the GDPR was enacted. At NetLicensing, we believe
that the GDPR is an important milestone in the data privacy landscape,
and we are committed to be compliant with the GDPR.  
  
We are constantly reviewing (and updating where necessary) all of our
internal processes, procedures, data systems, and documentation to
ensure that we are compliant with the GDPR. While much of our
preparation is happening behind the scenes, we are also working on a
number of initiatives that will be visible to our vendors. We are, among
other things:

-   Updating our Data Processing Agreement to meet the requirements of
    the GDPR in order to permit you to continue to lawfully use EU
    personal data with NetLicensing and permit NetLicensing to continue
    to lawfully receive and process that data;
-   Analyzing all of our current features and processes to determine
    whether any improvements or additions can be made to make them more
    efficient for those vendors subject to the GDPR;
-   Evaluating potential new GDPR-friendly features to add to our
    services.

In addition, we addressing any requests made by our
customers/vendors/end-customers related to their expanded individual
rights under the GDPR:

-   *Right to be forgotten*: You may terminate your NetLicensing account
    at any time by contacting us via email below, in which case we will
    permanently delete your account and all data associated with it.
-   *Right to object*: You may opt out of the inclusion of your data in
    our data science projects simply by contacting us via email below.
-   *Right to rectification*: You may access and update your
    NetLicensing account settings at any time to correct or complete
    your account information. You may also contact NetLicensing at any
    time to access, correct, amend or delete information that we hold
    about you.
-   *Right of access*: Our Privacy Policy describes what data we collect
    and how we use it. If you have specific questions about particular
    data, you can contact us for further information at any time.
-   *Right of portability*: We will export your account data to a third
    party at any time upon your request.

How can NetLicensing assist in your GDPR compliance efforts?
============================================================

You should review your organization’s data privacy and security
practices, and there are several ways in which NetLicensing can help.

<span class="aui-icon icon-hint">Icon</span>

In order to outline specifics of how we will process personal data and
what our obligations are as well as the obligations of our
vendors/customers, we’ve developed a [Data Processing Agreement
(DPA)](17433057.html) that we enter into free of charge with anyone who
uses our service and requests it.

Expansion of Individual Rights
------------------------------

NetLicensing can help you promptly respond to requests from your
end-customers pursuant to their expanded individual rights under the
GDPR.

-   *Right to be forgotten*: You may [delete individual end-customers
    data](How-to-delete-licensee-data_17433029.html) upon their request
    at any time. In addition, individual end-customers may contact
    NetLicensing directly to request deletion of their data from
    NetLicensing systems.
-   *Right to object*: You may opt out of the inclusion of your
    end-customers’ data in our data science projects simply by
    contacting us via email below.
-   *Right to rectification*: You may [access and update your licensees'
    data](How-to-access-and-update-licensee-data_17433027.html) within
    your NetLicensing account to correct or complete stored information
    upon their request at any time. In addition, any data subject
    (including your end-customers) may contact NetLicensing directly to
    access, correct, and/or delete information that NetLicensing may
    hold about the data subject as explained in our Privacy Policy.
    There is no charge for vendors or end-customers to access or update
    their Personal Information.
-   *Right of access*: Our Privacy Policy describes what data we collect
    and how we use it. As mentioned above, any of your end-customers may
    contact us directly to request to access information that we hold
    about them.
-   *Right of portability*: You may [export any of stored licensees /
    licenses / transactional
    data](How-to-export-licensee-data_17433031.html) as a list or
    selected information within any list, at any time by accessing your
    NetLicensing account.

Stricter Consent and Processing Requirements
--------------------------------------------

You must lawfully obtain and process email addresses and other personal
data from your end-customers.

-   The personal data of your end-customers may be collected and
    transferred to NetLicensing using NetLicensing RESTful API and by
    means of the concrete implementation of your products and services.
    We encourage you to design your products and NetLicensing
    integration with the GDPR and data protection and security in mind,
    so you can meet your specific GDPR compliance needs.
-   The ability of your end-customers to withdraw consent or change
    preferences should be easily accessible. NetLicensing API can help
    you here to ease access and modification of this data.
-   Make sure that you are frequently updating any information stored
    within your NetLicensing account that relates to your end-customers,
    such as name and contact information when requested to do so by an
    end-customer.
-   You should also ensure that you are keeping accurate records,
    especially of your end-customers consent permitting you to send them
    marketing emails, store and use their personal data, and any other
    processing activities which you are undertaking. NetLicensing can
    help you obtain proof of consent and will store a record of your
    end-customers’ consent in your NetLicensing account. When you use a
    NetLicensing Shop, NetLicensing records the email address, IP
    address, and timestamp associated with every end-customer who
    completes and submits the shopping cart, providing you with
    easy-to-access [proof of
    consent](How-to-access-and-verify-consent-given-by-end-customer_17433045.html).
-   Keep in mind that any consent you obtain from your end-customers
    must comply with the GDPR requirements, irrespective of when that
    consent was obtained.
-   **We recommend consulting with local counsel to determine if
    consents obtained prior to the GDPR comply with its requirements, or
    whether you should instead contact your end-customers to re-request
    consent in accordance with the GDPR requirements or rely on a
    different lawful basis for your processing under the GDPR.**
-   You should review any NetLicensing integrations or add-ons that you
    are using (or plan to use), and any terms associated with those, to
    ensure that you have adequately disclosed potential data processing
    activities associated with your use of those services to your
    end-customers.
-   You should review the privacy statement and practices applicable to
    your organization and ensure that they provide proper notice that
    the personal data of your end-customers will be [transferred to
    NetLicensing and processed by NetLicensing](17433024.html).
