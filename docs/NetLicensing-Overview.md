NetLicensing Overview
=====================


Innovative Licensing Solution
-----------------------------

<a href="https://netlicensing.io" class="external-link">Labs64 NetLicensing</a>
is a first-class solution in the *Licensing as a Service (LaaS)* sector.

Based on open standards, it provides a cost effective, integrated and
scalable platform for software vendors and developers who want to
concentrate on their product's core functionality instead of spending
resources on developing an own license management software.  
NetLicensing allows vendors and developers to enable license management
for their new or existing products right away and with minimum effort.

An Ecosystem of Licensing Models
--------------------------------

With NetLicensing you have a choice of ready-to-use licensing models or
customized licensing models may be created to suit your unique business
needs and goals.

Below are just a few examples of various license types that can be
linked together to form a licensing model within the NetLicensing
Ecosystem:

-   Evaluation licenses
-   Single-user licenses
-   Time-limited licenses
-   'Pay-per-use' licenses
-   'Pay-per-system' licenses

NetLicensing has an open architecture that allows easy extension with
new licensing models.

How it works
------------

As a vendor, you need just three steps to integrate NetLicensing into
your product. Once the product delivered to customers, the customers
purchase their licenses directly at NetLicensing Shop, without the need
of further product vendor intervention. Payments for the licenses are
credited directly to the account of the product vendor through the
payment service built into NetLicensing Shop.

The following steps describe main integration and operation tasks:

#### Integration tasks:

[Plan](Planning_11010227.html): No matter if you already have a product
or plan to create a new one, NetLicensing can be added at every stage.
All you need is to clearly formulate your licensing needs.

[Setup](Setting-up_11010228.html): NetLicensing Management Console
(NMC) is the integrated online administration center that allows you to
control all licensing aspects of your products. Once you have decided on
the licensing scheme, log in to NetLicensing Management Console and
create desired licensing configuration. You can get back to NetLicensing
Management Console at any time to alter your configuration or monitor
the licenses. Besides, NetLicensing business intelligence module will
consolidate your product usage information in regular reports.

[Integrate](Integration_11010229.html): Your product needs to
communicate with NetLicensing in order to get the actual licensing
information. Here comes NetLicensing API into play. With just a single
request to NetLicensing API your software receives the complete
licensing information for the specified customer. The licensing
information is already processed and conveniently formed for direct use
in your product's business logic.

#### Operational tasks:

<img src="assets/images/11010237/10977335.png" class="confluence-embedded-image" />
Deliver your product or service to customers, assigning a unique
identity to each customer. This unique identity is referred as "Licensee
Number".

<img src="assets/images/11010237/10977334.png" class="confluence-embedded-image" />
Using the assigned Licensee Number, your product will query via
NetLicensing API (see Integration step 3) the actual licensing state of
the customer.

complexity of multiple individual monetary transactions.
