## Question

We sell to distributors who sell to partners who sell to end-users. 
Distributors buy our software in advance, install it on their devices, then resell them. Between the time distributors buy the license to us, and the time users start using the software, there might be some months. Maintenance starts when users use the software for the first time.

## Answer

Yes, reseller mode can be established as well.
 
There will be two options:

**Option 1: Predefined Licensee**

This option is suitable for resellers with a low number of customers.

With this option, you'd need to create Licensees via NetLicensing Management Console and share their numbers with your resellers.

**Auto-Created Licensee**

This option is suitable for resellers with a high number of customers, where pre-creation of hight number of the Licensees isn't feasible.

With this option, you'd need to create an APIKey with Role "ROLE_APIKEY_OPERATION" ( see also https://www.labs64.de/confluence/display/NLICPUB/Security ) and let your resellers create Licensees whenever they need a new one.
