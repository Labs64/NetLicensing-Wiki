Cannot login on the new NetLicensing Management Console
=============

## Question

We are having problems login into the NetLicensing Management Console.

I'm using my EMail ID to login on the NetLicensing Management Console.
It works on the old Console (https://go.netlicensing.io/console/v2/), but on the new Console (https://ui.netlicensing.io) I'm getting `The Username field format is invalid` error; therefore, I cannot login anymore.

## Answer

Apologies for this inconvenience!

We are currently in the transition phase for the new Management Console and as of now (Q4/2019) we yet to enable `email` and `vendor number` login in the new Management Console.
You can use your chosen `username` to login.

We'll address this login issue in one of the next releases.


You can use the old console for time being: https://go.netlicensing.io/console/v2/
