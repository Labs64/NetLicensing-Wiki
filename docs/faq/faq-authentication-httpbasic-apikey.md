## Question

I'm integrating NetLicensing API in my python application and wondering which authentication method should I use to connect to NetLicensing.

## Answer

NetLicensing offering two [authentication alternatives](security): *HTTP Basic Authentication* and *API Key Identification*.

### HTTP Basic Auth

In this approach, base64 encoded username and password need to be sent within a request header to prove authentication.
As this approach uses the HTTP header, so thereâ€™s no need to handshakes or other complex response systems.

>NOTE: While using Basic Auth you will be granted full access to the NetLicensing endpoints within your vendor account. You need to make sure the credentials stored and delivered in a secure way within your application and not visible to the end-customers.

*In most of the cases, we recommend **API Key Identification** as the most secure and flexible option.*

### API Key Identification (recommended)

API Keys allow limited access to NetLicensing API methods depending on the chosen [API Key role](security#api-key-identification).

Leveraging API Keys improves security by:

- Reducing the need to store sensitive credentials on the client-side
- Limiting the set of possible operations which can be done with a particular key
- Creating context-specific keys for the specified customers' segments, products or use cases
- API Keys can be easily revoked if compromised

API Keys are *not expirable* and can be created via NetLicnsing Management Console ([Settings](https://ui.netlicensing.io/#/settings) view) or RESTful API ([TokenService](token-services)).
