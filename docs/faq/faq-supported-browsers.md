## Question

What browsers are supported by NetLicensing Console?

## Answer

All popular modern browsers (Chrome, Safari, FireFox, IE/Edge, Opera) are supported, however we only consider latest releases as recommended by the browser vendor. The only known incompatible browser is the Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 8.1, if you hit the problem with IE11 (page is not responding) we recommend to use Microsoft Edge instead.
