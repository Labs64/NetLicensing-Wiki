## Question

* What is the maximum amount allowed for a single PayPal transaction?
* Is there a limit on the number of PayPal transactions?
* Is there a limit on the total receipts via PayPal?

## Answer

As of 2013:

- European Union: The upper limit is EUR 8,000.
- United States: The upper limit is USD 10,000.
- Other countries have similar ranges.

It's important to note that there might be additional limitations on the buyer's side, such as restrictions on unverified PayPal accounts in the EU or limitations related to credit cards and bank accounts. For accurate information, it's recommended to consult your local PayPal office or corresponding financial institution.

There are no restrictions on the number of PayPal transactions you can conduct.

After reaching a certain annual receipt threshold via PayPal (EUR 2,500 in the EU as of 2013), PayPal may require a one-time extended account verification.

For specific details, please reach out to your local PayPal representative.
