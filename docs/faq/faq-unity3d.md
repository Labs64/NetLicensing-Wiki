## Question

How can I use NetLicensing in the Unity3D projects?

## Answer

We provide <a href="https://github.com/Labs64/NetLicensingClient-csharp" class="external-link">C# wrapper</a> for NetLicensing RESTful API, which can be used in Unity3D projects.

Place this library in the plugins folder of the Unity3D project's, so this will be included in your unity scripts.
This library provides public classes, which can be used to interface with the NetLicensing services.

Additional client libraries for other programming languages such as Java, JavaScript, PHP, C++ can be found [here](client-libraries).
